This is a simple two-player game of tic-tac-toe.


Technologies Used:


Approach Taken:

I started off searching through every google hit of 'tic tac toe javascript' and found that all the results were confusing and didn't make sense to me. Eventually, I remembered that WDI Fundamentals pre-work went over portions of tic tac toe and based the game logic off that but utilizing a 2D array instead of using switch/case. I then solved the following problems:
  - Figuring out all winning combinations
  - Finding which player won and then declaring who it was
  - Implementing click functions with jQuery
  - Alternating between X and O
  - Making the game logic interact with the UI
  - Resetting the game board after a win/tie
