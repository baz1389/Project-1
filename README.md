This is a simple two-player game of tic-tac-toe. X goes before O. To win you must get 3 X's or O's in a row.


Technologies Used:

CodeSchool.com, Codeacademy.com, Stackoverflow, MDN, W3schools, GA Instructors


Approach Taken:

I remembered that WDI Fundamentals pre-work utilized tic-tac-toe when explaining functions. Based on those explainations I utilized a 2D array instead of using switch/case. I then solved the following problems:
  - Figuring out all winning combinations
  - Finding which player won and then declaring who it was
  - Implementing click functions with jQuery
  - Alternating between X and O
  - Making the game logic interact with the UI
  - Resetting the game board after a win/tie

Unsolved Problems:

The "Current Player: X/O" text at the top of the board only shows whose turn it is once a click is registered on the board (i.e if it is X's turn the message will still show current player as O and as soon as the click occurs [places an X on the board] it will show that the current player is X).


I ran out of time to make the site look aesthetically pleasing. Not very happy with how the site currently looks.
